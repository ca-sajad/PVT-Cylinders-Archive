# PVT-Cylinders-Archive
## A JavaFX GUI to manage the gas and oil cylinders used in a PVT Lab
### This program has two tabs: Cylinders List and Statistics.
The Cylinders List tab has two tables. The table on the left shows the list of all Cylinders in the lab. The table on the right shows all the operations performed on each cylinder. By clicking on a cylinder in the left table, its operations are shown in the right table. The cylinders in the left table are arranged alphabetically and the operations in the right table are arranged based on date of the operation.
There are buttons for creating new cylinders and new operations. There's a search bar that allows searching based on the cylinder's name or the well whose sample is in the cylinder.
The coloring scheme in the left table is described in the Help menu. There are two other menues (Edit Cylinder and Edit Operation) for editing the current entries.

The Statistics tab shows a summary of data in the fist tab in charts such as the one bellow. These charts can be created based on sample type (oil/gas), their staus (in/out of the lab, in/out of service, filled/empty, etc.) and also well name.
