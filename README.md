# PVT-Cylinders-Archive
## A JavaFX GUI to manage the gas and oil cylinders used in a PVT Lab
### This program has two tabs: Cylinders List and Statistics.
The Cylinders List tab has two tables. The table on the left shows the list of all Cylinders in the lab. The table on the right shows all the operations performed on each cylinder. 

By clicking on a cylinder in the left table, its operation history is shown in the right table. The cylinders in the left table are arranged alphabetically and the operations in the right table are arranged based on date of the operation.

The user can use "New Cyliner" and "New Operation" buttons to create new cylinders and new operations, respectively. 

There's also a search bar that allows searching based on the cylinder's name or the well whose sample is collected in the cylinder.

The coloring scheme in the left table is described in the Help menu. There are two other menues (Edit Cylinder and Edit Operation) for editing the current entries.

The Statistics tab shows a summary of first tab's data in charts. 

Charts can be created based on sample type (oil/gas), their status (in/out of the lab, in/out of service, filled/empty, etc.), and well name.
